# Calculator App (iOS)

This is a fully functional, simple calculator app built with **Swift using Xcode**. This app was created to **demonstrate my skills and understanding in Swift, SwiftUI, and using Xcode**. It showcases both functionality and responsive design using modern iOS development tools and practices.


## ðŸš€ Features

### âœ¨ Splash Screen with Lottie Animation
Upon launch, the app presents a beautiful splash screen animated with **Lottie** created in **Figma**.
- **Design Tool:** The animation was meticulously crafted in **Figma**, ensuring a polished and branded introduction.
- **Animation Format:** It utilizes a Lottie JSON file, which provides lightweight, scalable, and high-quality animations.
- **Seamless Integration:** The Lottie animation was seamlessly incorporated into the Xcode project using the **Lottie iOS SDK**, appearing gracefully upon app launch before transitioning to the main calculator interface.

### ðŸ“± Landscape Mode Support
The app fully supports **landscape (horizontal) mode**. When the device is rotated:
- The UI adapts smoothly.
- The **number storage area** (where current calculations or memory are shown) dynamically **moves to the left** side of the screen for optimal readability and usability.

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (âˆ’)
- Multiplication (Ã—)
- Division (Ã·)

All core operations are implemented with Swiftâ€™s robust number handling to ensure precision and reliability.

### ðŸŽ¯ Clean, Responsive UI
- Built with **SwiftUI** and Auto Layout for dynamic screen adaptation
- Touch-friendly buttons with haptic feedback (if supported)
- Intuitive design inspired by native iOS components

### ðŸ’¾ State Preservation
The app preserves its current state during backgrounding or orientation changes, so users donâ€™t lose their place in a calculation.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
